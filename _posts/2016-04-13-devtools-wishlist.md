1. This mostly regards Chrome apps and extensions. When a window is created that previously had the devtools open, it remembers
that the devtools were open, and reopens devtools. Unfortunately there is some delay and the devtools have not yet attached, so they will
miss catching any exceptions for the first few hundred ms or so.

2. Turn off editing in source window. 99% of the time I don't want to edit in the source window, I want to type something in
the console. I would like to turn off editing and have keyboard focus be on the console window. Currently I press escape twice
about every time I focus in the devtools to force focus on the console window.

3. An option to make a sound when we enter the debugger. Ding!
