The past few days I've had an external monitor plugged into my macbook. It's been nice having more real estate.

But now I'm sitting in a comfortable chair away from my monitor trying to do some work. But there's too many windows! And I can't move them around!

I want my dream setup -- virtual desktops that I can page around by just moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. Why does osx only let me page desktops horizontally? And why isn't there an option to page between the screens by moving the mouse over there?

I want more options, not fewer!
