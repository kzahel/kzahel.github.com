I just published a very simple extension to skip to the next track in the [spotify web player](https://play.spotify.com). Here is the 
[chrome web store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cioodogigbffcemogihoifckgacjaakc). The source code is also on [github](https://github.com/kzahel/skip-track-extension).

Make sure to set a keyboard shortcut for easiest use (go to the [chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions) and on the bottom click "Keyboard shortcuts". Enjoy!
