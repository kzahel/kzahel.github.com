I have been very happy with me new Macbook Pro with fancy retina display. The screen is beautiful and the pleasure it affords me is not unlike having some cold sweet cream melting on my tongue. Only on my eyes.

Allow me to complain about how the OS, OSX, is failing me...

- moving windows around is too hard (have to navigate my cursor to the top of the window title)
- resizing windows is too hard (have to move to the very corner of the window)
- moving windows between desktops is too hard (have to wait around on the edge for about 1/3 a second)
- etc etc

I lose so much time just because the window manager is so rigid.
