I just put a new user interface on my [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb).
I used the post 1.0 Polymer release and a few paper components. The documentation for Polymer is a little obtuse for somebody
like me who just wants to code a UI without learning the detailed inner workings of Polymer. But altogether it was OK.

If you're ever in need of a basic static web server, definitely give it a try! It's open source with a MIT license and [available on github](https://github.com/kzahel/web-server-chrome)

Ever since Chrome 44 went stable about a month ago, ChromeOS has had the ability to open up the firewall. So
now the web server app can also serve files over the local network on a Chromebook. Pretty useful!
