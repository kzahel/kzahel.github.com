I have a few friends who don't use facebook, at all. Well perhaps one day I will manage this myself, but for
a number of reasons I haven't yet managed this. I do look forward to the day that facebook is no longer relevant
to my life.

But I have done one thing that nobody else I know does. I have uninstalled the facebook app from my android phone
and haven't missed it in the slightest. I now use the mobile facebook website instead.
There are three main reasons for this

- I don't like all the permissions the app requests.

I'm generally paranoid about permission prompts and like to reduce the number of apps which have access to essentially
all data on my phone and all sensors on my phone.

- Facebook messenger. I was so annoyed when I could no longer read or send facebook messages within the app.

I don't want to have two facebook apps installed, both with more permissions than any other app except possibly google services. Also
I have a low end phone and this is slow.

- Links opening in a webview.

This is the straw that broke the camel's back. After clicking on open in the actual web browser several times,
I decided it was over.


So what are the drawbacks of using the facebook mobile website instead of the native app? For me, there are none. Horay!
